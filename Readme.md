##### PUBLIC DOMAIN LICENSE ( IT'S IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN )
# From Lower Earth Orbit, it's Alpha Simprini

Alpha Simprini is a browser application framework. It is a terrible awful mish-mash of ideas from Backbone and SproutCore/Ember.js

#### Modular (or something)

Alpha Simprini uses [Pathology](https://github.com/collin/pathology) and [Taxi](https://github.com/collin/taxi)
to power the underlying Object model and event/databinding systems.

## Views

#### No Templating Language

Alpha Simprini doesn't use a templating language. Your DOM is generated by code.
The opinion behind this is that a templating language (even so-called 'logicless' templates)
really want to be Classes with methods deep within their hearts. Except they don't end up
doing a very good job of approximating the experience. 

( You could certainly build a templating language on top of the Alpha Simprini dom generation
and data-binding api. But why? )

#### Declarative Data Binding

Declare your data as it will live in the DOM. Ordered list? Selection models? Relationships? Simple fields?

```coffee
MyApp.ThingyView = AS.View.extend
  content: ->
    @h1 "This is the thingy view!"
    @p "This thing is ", @thingy.description, "."
    @ul ->
      @bind @thingy.children, (child) ->
        @li -> @bind(child.name).attr
```

When the data changes, the DOM will be updated to reflect those changes automatically.
All event handlers are cleaned up as objects are removed too.

## Models

#### Domain Modeling

Model your domain with fields, and relationships: hasMany, hasOne, belongsTo.

```coffee
CookBook.Recipe = AS.Model.extend()
CookBook.Recipe.field "minutesToPrepare", type: Number
CookBook.Recipe.field "veggeratian", type: Boolean
CookBook.Recipe.field "title"

CookBook.Ingredient = AS.Model.extend()
CookBook.Ingredient.field "name"
CookBook.Ingredient.field "quantity", type: Number
CookBook.Ingredient.belongsTo "recipe"

CookBook.Recipe.hasMany "ingredients", 
  model: -> MyApp.Ingredient
  inverse: "recipe"
```

#### Real Time Collaboration

Alpha Simprini ships with support for real-time collaboration with [ShareJS](https://github.com/josephg/ShareJS/)

1. Configure the connection between Alpha Simprini and ShareJS

```coffee
# The default ShareJsURL looks like this:
AS.ShareJsURL = "http://#{window?.location.host or 'localhost'}/sjs"
# Set it as neccessary for your server configuration.
```

2. Mixin ShareJS support

```coffee
Editor.Document = AS.Model.extend()
AS.Model.Share.extend(Editor.Document)
```

3. Load your document by ID

```coffee
document = Editor.Document.load("documentid")
```

At this point you can use the model as usual. You don't have to wait for the object to properly connect to
the ShareJS server. Any chanegs you make to the object will be properly applied when the connection is made.
