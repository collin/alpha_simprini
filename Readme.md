##### PUBLIC DOMAIN LICENSE ( IT'S IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN )
# From Lower Earth Orbit, it's Alpha Simprini

Alpha Simprini is a browser application framework. It is a terrible awful mish-mash of ideas from Backbone and SproutCore/Ember.js

#### Modular (or something)

Alpha Simprini uses [Pathology](https://github.com/collin/pathology) and [Taxi](https://github.com/collin/taxi)
to power the underlying Object model and event/databinding systems.

## Views

#### No Templating Language

Alpha Simprini doesn't use a templating language. Your DOM is generated by code.
The opinion behind this is that a templating language (even so-called 'logicless' templates)
really want to be Classes with methods deep within their hearts. Except they don't end up
doing a very good job of approximating the experience. 

( You could certainly build a templating language on top of the Alpha Simprini dom generation
and data-binding api. But why? )

#### Declarative Data Binding

Declare your data as it will live in the DOM. Ordered list? Selection models? Relationships? Simple fields?

```coffee
MyApp.ThingyView = AS.View.extend
  content: ->
    @h1 "This is the thingy view!"
    @p "This thing is ", @thingy.description, "."
    @ul ->
      @bind @thingy.children, (child) ->
        @li -> @bind(child.name).attr
```

When the data changes, the DOM will be updated to reflect those changes automatically.
All event handlers are cleaned up as objects are removed too.

#### Domain Modeling

Model your domain with fields, and relationships: hasMany, hasOne, belongsTo.

```coffee
CookBook.Recipe = AS.Model.extend()
CookBook.Recipe.field "minutesToPrepare", type: Number
CookBook.Recipe.field "veggeratian", type: Boolean
CookBook.Recipe.field "title"

CookBook.Ingredient = AS.Model.extend()
CookBook.Ingredient.field "name"
CookBook.Ingredient.field "quantity", type: Number
CookBook.Ingredient.belongsTo "recipe"

CookBook.Recipe.hasMany "ingredients", 
  model: -> MyApp.Ingredient
  inverse: "recipe"
```
